Lines 1-25 are reserved for comments
The comment lines do not require any special characters such as "#"
All other lines are for the legitimate extension
Extensions cannot access files in real-time and do not run code
The structure of an extension is as follows:
The first line is the extesion type
Types include:
- Syntax (Is used to edit keywords and settings)
- Color Theme Changer (Is used to change the color theme)
- Font (Is used to change the font size and family)
- Hybrid (Is used to edit more than one of the above)
The second line is the permissions required to use the extension
These include:
- keywords.txt
- settings.txt
- color_theme.txt
- font.txt
These can be added together using the "|" character and can be in any order
An example of the second line would be "color_theme.txt|settings.txt"
The third line is the name of the extension
The fourth line is the description of the extension
The fifth line is the author of the extension
The lines thereafter contain the extension which are detailed in explanation blocks
Explanation blocks start and end with block holders and start and end with "<" and ">"
See the default extension as a reference!
